      <p>
        You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms,
        including but not limited to a dispute, claim or controversy relating to the breach,
        termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services
        (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Puls
        Technologies, Inc.. Notwithstanding the preceding, each party retains the right to bring an
        individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable
        relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
        infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights,
        including but not necessarily limited to a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or
        patents. By using the Services you acknowledge and agree that you and Puls Technologies,

        in any purported class action or other representative proceeding. Further, unless agreed to
        in writing by all parties to be bound, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
        person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative
        proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
        this Section 9 will be deemed void and unenforceable. Except as provided in the preceding
        sentence, this Section 9 will survive any termination of these Terms.
      </p>
      <h3>B. ARBITRATION RULES AND GOVERNING LAW</h3>
      <p>
        The arbitration specified under these Terms will be administered by the American Arbitration
        Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
        Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes promulgated by the AAA (the "AAA
        Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Section 9. (The AAA Rules are available
        at the AAA’s website https://www.adr.org). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the
        interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
      </p>
      <h3>C. ARBITRATION PROCESS</h3>
      <p>
        A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written
        Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will be either a
        retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state where the Services are
        rendered, and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute
        arbitrators. The AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules in the
        event the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery
        of the Demand for Arbitration.
      </p>
      <h3>D. ARBITRATION LOCATION AND PROCEDURE</h3>
      <p>
        Unless you and Puls Technologies, Inc. otherwise mutually agree in writing, (a) These Terms
        shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
        excluding its conflicts of law rules, and (b) the exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitration
        will be in the State of Delaware. If your claim does not exceed $12,500, then the
        arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Puls Technologies,
        Inc. submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines
        that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $12,500, your right to a hearing will be
        solely determined by the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a
        reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of
        the arbitration, and so long as consistent with the AAA rules.
      </p>
      <h3>E. ARBITRATOR'S DECISION</h3>
      <p>
        The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The
        arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
        arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court
        having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's damages award shall be consistent with the
        terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above. The arbitrator may award declaratory
        or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to
        provide relief guaranteed by the claimant's individual claim. The prevailing party in
        arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent
        provided under applicable law.
      </p>
      <h3>F. FEES </h3>
      <p>
        The responsibility for payment of any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be
